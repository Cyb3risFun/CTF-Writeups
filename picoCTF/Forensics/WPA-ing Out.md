# **_WPA-ing Out_**
## Description
> I thought that my password was super-secret, but it turns out that passwords passed over the AIR can be CRACKED, especially if I used the same wireless network password as one in the rockyou.txt credential dump.
Use this 'pcap file' and the rockyou wordlist. The flag should be entered in the picoCTF{XXXXXX} format

## Solution
Crack the password with `aircrack-ng`
```console
❯ aircrack-ng wpa-ing_out.pcap -w /usr/share/dict/rockyou.txt
