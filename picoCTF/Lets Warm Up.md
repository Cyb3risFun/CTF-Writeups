# Lets Warm Up
## Description
If I told you a word started with `0x70` in hexadecimal, what would it start with in `ASCII`?
## Solution
Simpily match it with the `ASCII Table`
First Column in the ASCII table is decimal number, second column is hexadecimal number, `0x` identifies that it is a hexadecimal number, so ignore `0x` and look for `70` in the second column of ascii table, we find character `p`
Here is a link to an [ASCII Table](https://www.rapidtables.com/code/text/ascii-table.html)
