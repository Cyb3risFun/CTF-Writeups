# _The Numbers_
## Description
The numbers... what do they mean?
## Solution
The Numbers in the png file
```
16 9 3 15 3 20 6 { 20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14 }
```
We know that there is a patern for the flag, picoCTF{...}, Which means `16 9 3 15 3 20 6` &harr; `picoCTF`
Notice that the number `3` is repeated and so does the letter `c`, in the same position, c is the third letter in alphabets, this is likely a `A1Z26` encoding, decode it and get the flag
